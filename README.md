I'm a fourth-year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Operations Research at Columbia University. I come from Taipei, Taiwan and will be joining Amazon Web Services in Seattle as an SDE after graduation. My main interests are in software engineering and artificial intelligence, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn more or to work on cool projects!
