I'm a fourth-year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Operations Research at Columbia University. I come from Taipei, Taiwan and will be joining AWS in Seattle as an SDE after graduation. My main interests are in software engineering and AI/ML, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn more!
